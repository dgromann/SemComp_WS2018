Hi Vince!

I need to check when I can
release this report. I have just testified,
so I think it will be any day now,
and I will then give you a password.

I will be out of days until July 5.

I see you are coming to Crete! Another chance
to talk!

Warm regards, Darrell

 It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

Attached are suggested comments on the draft NERC bill for which we were asked to provide comments by today.  You will see that the response is a firm, but polite -- no thanks.  While I doubt NERC assumes that silence means support by their deadline today, I would like to get something to them by COB if at all possible.  (I will be on vacation tomorrow in any event).  With apologies for the short turn around, please call or e-mail your comments or OK this afternoon.

If you are able to provide this to Dan for the meeting I would appreciate
it.

He may not want to circulate it to the group.  It is intended as a work

Jim and Ken --

Attached is an article for eBiz (our biweekly online newsletter), which we are scheduled to launch at 7:30 a.m. Friday.  Kelly Kimberly has reviewed it, but has asked that you view the article as well.  Since only EBS employees received your memo about the restructuring -- and the rest of the employees did not receive any communication -- it is extremely important to provide information through this vehicle.  

Please let me know of your approval or if you have any questions.  

Thank you.

Rob,
After reviewing both Lauren's and Jeff's comments, I have little to add.  I 
would, however, replace the last part of Jeff's sentence in the first 
paragraph with "and there is a need to take a comprehensive look at 
strategies for reducing CO2  emissions more broadly, in ways that make 
economic and environmental sense" to avoid mentioning the Kyoto Protocol 
directly.
And, I'd like to reiterate Lauren's suggestion that the article should direct 
employees to our climate change policy statement in last year's EHS Report 
and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and 
communicate their thoughts.
Thanks,
Catherine

		 Subject: Ken Lay Statement to Employees on Bush CO2 Policy


(KEELER EDITS)
Here is my draft for Ken in response to Ann's eBiz request.  Comments welcome


"The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to 
support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power 
plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy.   His decision was 
based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are 
experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate 
could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be 
ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas 
emissions is unworkable in its current form.  

"I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration 
would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the 
long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative "anti-environment" 
reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations.  Because this is an 
important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the 
administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global 
climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts 
of action regulate CO2 emissions."

"The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a 
private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market.  We are well-positioned 
through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural 
gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and 
tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron 
Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions 
trading and risk management."

"A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of 
sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint.  Enron will 
continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring 
a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to 
build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and 
tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to 
make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way.  If we're able to make 
meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx, SO2 and mercury -- and we do it 
in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on 
CO2 whether it is regulated or not."

In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to 
position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an 
industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy 
and environmental problems.

Hi Mr. Lay,

I am a Specialist in Corp. PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal 
eBiz publication.  I am working on a story about the recent issue with 
respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to 
President Bush's as well as the coal industry.  

I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide 
emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his 
decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns 
that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to 
natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher 
electricity prices causing problems similar to California.   

I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees.  A 
quote from you about this issue would be great.  I would also be interested 
in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling 
CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2.

Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks,
 Ann Schmidt

Ginger, would you please forward the following request to the State Goverment 
Affairs group for me.  Thanks.


Attached for your review and comments is the second group of recommended 
practices worked on by the UBP group.  The Suppliers that have participated 
in the UBP plan to submit joint comments to this report and I would like to 
be able to incorporate any comments that individuals in Enron's State 
Government Affairs Group may have into the overall Supplier comments.  In 
order to meet the deadline for comments, I need to receive your comments no 
later than noon, August 28th.  The best way to submit these comments is by 
red-lining the actual document.  

You can also review and download the entire UBP report, including the 
finalized chapters and the chapters "out for comments", on 
http://www.ubpnet.org/workshop/download.htm.

Please feel free to contact me (712-366-3399 or pager 888-912-1426) if you 
have any questions.  Thanks for your time and consideration.

Steve we briefly discussed last Tuesday the possibility of using Mr Lay's 
contact with the Chairman of Toyota, Mr Okuda, to assist us in securing a 
senior executive from Toyota to speak at the May 15 conference in Tokyo.  

We agreed that I should draft a letter for Jeff Skilling to send to Mr Okuda. 
I have had a rethink and believe that as a matter of courtesy (Japanese 
style), it would be preferable in the first instance if the contact with Mr 
Okuda is done from chairman to chairman. Mr Lay's letter will serve as an 
introduction to Jeff Skilling, and will also permit Enron Japan to follow up 
directly with Mr Okuda's staff in Japan. We can then draft a letter for Jeff 
Skilling to confirm arrangements.

I attach a draft letter for that purpose. If the revised approach is in 
order, I will liaise on the matter with Rosalee and Sherri, with a copy to 
you.

I realize you have pushed these guys already, but the attached letter would 
be better if not sent at all.  It doesn't address the real underlying problem 
-- that a "reliability bill" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem.  
Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a 
political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for 
action next year.  If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go 
out at all.

Per my first e-mail, here's MidAmerican's position letter on the stand alone 
Reliability measure.  Seems the best we can do with the utilities who have 
been supporting our position is to have them take a "no position" stance on 
the stand alone bill.

Looks fine to me.  I have not cross checked the lists, but I assume you have 
included everyone who was designated to serve on the PRCs per the original 
memo (in addition to the new bus unit additions)

Subject: DRAFT - AA PRC MEMO

Attached is a draft memo (including attachments) outlining the modifications 
we discussed last week.  We can communicate changes by email, or I'll be 
happy to arrange a short conference call.  If possible, I would like to 
distribute this by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  After the four of us 
reach consensus, I suggest we preview Cindy (and maybe the HR heads) prior to 
distributing.  

You will note that based on conversations I had with Skilling last week 
(where he emphasized his desire that we have one program, rather than a 
fractured program by business unit), I have added a review of the business 
unit distributions to the final meeting where we discuss the top perfomers.  
I've also added Janet Dietrich (tent.) and another EES person (tbd) to the AA 
Committee, since they have a large group of AAs and no representation on the 
committee.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, and thanks for your 
help.  Ted and Terry did all the hard work.

Regards,
Billy


Click Print Preview or print a hard copy - it's easier to read.
We do not have the Europe groups included.  Should probably include, or note 
in the memo itself that info is forthcoming.

Dear Colleague,

Several of you have pointed out that the Manifesto is a bit long.  We will
endeavor to shorten it somewhat which will be possible as there is some
duplication; however, more importantly we plan to add an executive summary
which will be the editorial link version that most will read.  I hope to
get that out by 5:00 PM today.

Thanks,
David

Can we also get something in the stip that limits the market making activity 
or at least promises a reexamination of the scope of the market making 
activity after some period of time.  Also, can we strengthen the language to 
give us something beyond simply a right to file  -- which is a right we have 
anyway.

		 Subject: PJM Stip


Attached is the proposed Stip to allow PJM to move forward as an RTO.

In the Stip, we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our 
acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets.

My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion 
management.  

While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited, I believe 
that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast 
markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk.

In addition, I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its 
software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want 
everything in their package.

Sarah is out until Monday when we need to get back with PJM.

Jim

Vince,

I am sorry to send this late.
I had to finish a report for DealBench team yesterday,
and read papers and prepare slides for the meeting scheduled tomorrow 2PM.
Because I thought those work has to be done first,
I didn't put the priority to the summary report.

Attached is the summary report.
However, I hope I have more time to double check this.

I'll do the proofreadding, and send this again,
after the presentation tomorrow, 
together with the summary report of tomorrow's presentation.    

I am sorry for this again.
Jinbaek

See NERC memo below that was just received.  They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to "resolve" the reliability legislation next week -- August 9th.  Of course, this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model (even the shortened one), and not the PJM model that others prefer to use.  We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version, even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting, or simply "agree to disagree."

Subject:	revisions to reliability language


Reliability legislation coalition

I have attached a memo outlining the edits that NERC would make in the
7/19 discussion draft.  My memo does not take account of the suggestions
that have been circulated in the last day or so.  I've also attached a
marked-up version of the 7/19 draft indicating our changes.

I propose that we meet in Washington on Thursday, August 9, at 10:00
a.m., with the goal of coming to closure on reliability legislation that
is shorter and less detailed than the language in the pending bills, but
that still preserves the essence of an industry self-regulatory
organization.  I am working on a location and expect to provide that
information tomorrow.

I know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and that
schedules are already full, but schedules will become even more
difficult later in the month.  I take as our deadline having new
language for the Hill during the August recess.

Thank you in advance for your continuing efforts to bring this new model
for reliability into existence.

Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman 
paragraph:

 "Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave, in the 
Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing 
Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the 
Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Currently, Janet is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination 
organizations."

Leslie--A few nits.  Prebon Energy Inc. in the first sentence should not
have a comma.

Clause (a) in the carve-out as to what constitutes Confidential Information
should start "that is or becomes..."

I would put "as demonstrable by the receiving party" in parens at the end of
clause (c).

That's it.  If you want to have the agreement signed and faxed to me at

I agree.  I am almost through it -- and while there are improvements per our suggestions from the first draft -- there are both substantive and format problems -- i.e., it does not read very well in places, aside from substance.  Will fax Amr my comments on the text and leave with DC colleagues as I will be up in the Senate on RTOs this afternoon.

Attached as discussed is the second draft of the briefing documents for the Oct event. They have been separated per our request. These are fresh from Intellibridge and we in Houston have not reviewed them as well, but will be doing so over the weekend. 

The documents are attached in the order in which we intend them to appear in
the Briefing Book:

1. Brief History of the Western Power Crisis (Western Power Crisis.doc)
2. Western Power Crisis Timeline (timeline.pdf) -- (Please note that on this
timeline, we still need to cite sources for each of the date entries. Their
graphic designer will be able to do this for us on Wednesday of next week).
3. Responses to the Nation's Energy Crunch (energy crunch clean.doc)
4. Federal vs. State Energy Policy Jurisdiction (fedvsstate.doc)
5. The Status of U.S. Electricity Restructuring (progress of states.doc)

If the regulatory and government team could consolidate their feedback, it would be helpful. Once done, we would like to schedule a call for next Thursday at 3:30 pm, since we would like to do it when Intellibridge is in the DC office.

		 Subject: Re: Dereg Articles

I've taken the editor's pencil to Dan's draft.  Here's the result:

 Kirk Johnson's September 26th article, Debate on Need for New Power Plants 
Ignores Conservation, leaves readers with the misperception that competitive 
electricity markets discourage conservation.  True customer choice proves 
otherwise.
 My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine.  One of 
these customers is a  paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of 
homes.  When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we 
actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to 
do.  As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and 
residential customers didn't hear a word about "brownouts."
 The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to 
conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the 
regulatory elite.  It's proving true in Maine, why not give New York and 
other states the same choice?

If you like it, send it to the Letters to the Editor section at the New York 
Times.  The protocol is on the editorial page.

Thanks for the quick response,

I've finished marking up the drafts, and thought perhaps a few thoughts would 
give you some insight into the reasons for my revisions . Unfortunately, I 
was engaged in discussions about the course to pursue in light of Arthur 
Anderson's comments until almost 10pm, when I lost my typing help, so not 
much headway was made in inputting the changes last night. My secretary is 
supposed to be in early ( it is now nearly 8:00 and she still isn't in ! ), 
and I will enlist whatever other help I can get to turn these documents 
around.

For those not involved in the discussions last night, Roger advised us that 
Arthur Anderson had changes to the Xonon Technology Implementation Agreement 
designed to make clear ENA had no primary or secondary obligations under the 
XTIA. The principal change suggested by AA - the deletion of the last 
sentence of the BOLD language in Section 2.2 - removed the obligation for ENA 
to pick up any obligations under the agreement owed by West LB in excess of 
the "Cap". Note that this same change applies in the Agreement in Principle 
related to the purchase of turbines. 

XTIA Revision 4G.  AA's change did not appear to address comprehensively the 
principle AA espoused, ie, clarifying ENA had no primary or secondary 
obligations under the agreements. After much discussion and some 
consideration, I decided to prepare alternative markups of the XTIA - one 
that attempts to meet the AA directive while preserving a level of comfort 
for GE. I attempted this by increasing the limit on West LB's liability in 
Article 10 to $20 million from $9.9 million so that GE's recourse against 
West LB is the same as it had against West LB and ENA in the prior drafts, 
and by obligating West LB, in the default provisions, to pony up for an ENA 
default. I also extensively modified the Section 2.2 language ( taken 
verbatim from the LM 6000 deal ) to eliminate the limited recourse provisions 
favoring West LB, and in doing so made it easier to conclude that references 
to ENA in the agreement are references to ENA acting in an agency, and not 
its individual capacity. This notion is still pretty vague in the revision 
because I did not want to create too much discomfort in GE, since ENA 
explicitly acting in an agency capacity would mean there was no recourse 
against it ( since ultimate recourse would lie with the principal, West LB). 
Roger suggested I delete the limit on ENA's liability in Article 10 to remove 
the implication it had any, which I did ( and which means we have no upside 
protection if we are construed to have obligations under the XTIA.

The upshot is that in my opinion the 4g revision goes as far as possible 
toward placating AA while still retaining a possibility of selling it to GE. 
The sheer number of changes required by the substance of AA's comment, 
however, is bound to be disconcerting to GE at this stage of negotiations, 
particularly when GE's expectation was for a  markup incorporating the new 
business terms agreed yesterday afternoon (calling for payment of the 
Development Funds to be completed by September 30,2000, with the possibility 
of a refund of a portion of the Development Fund Payment if the December 31 
Milestone is not timely completed) and some clean ups/clarifications.

Note that in both revision 4g and 4ga, Section4.3 now provides that the Xonon 
credit created is only exercisable by CCSI on and after December 31,2000, so 
that the credit amount can reflect the deduction of any Milestone 4 refund 
amount paid by GE if it does not complete that Milestone on time. I think the 
dollar value of the credit should be adjusted downward if a portion of the 
Development Funds paid on September 30 are in fact refunded in December. We 
need to make sure to make provision in the Acquisition and Development 
Agreement that any Milestone 4 refund received by West LB is paid over to 
ENA, since West LB will have been repaid its advances on September 30,2000.

XTIA Revision 4GA . This alternate revision to the XTIA takes a minimalist 
approach, and incorporates only the new business terms, some minor clean 
up/clarifications, and the AA change to Section 2.2 and the change to Article 
10 ( to remove a cap for ENA's laibility) suggested by Roger. It seems to me 
it does not address meaningfully the AA admonition that ENA may not have 
primary or secondary liability under the XTIA if it wants to stay outside of 
the rigors of FAS 97-10. However, it has the singular advantage of looking a 
lot like what GE and West LB expect to see in the revision.

Option Repurchase Agreement. This revision was complicated by the possible 
refund of the a portion of the Development Funds by GE if it failed to 
complete Milestone 4 by December 31,2000 ( an attempt to retain some 
accountability for GE's performance given that it is being paid for that 
Milestone on September 30 to satisfy CCSI ). Because the option repurchase 
must occur on or before September 30, it isn't clear what will happen 
December 31, so its hard to figure out what to pay if the contract is not 
cancelled by September 30 or what the credits are worth on that date. 

Since CCSI is the direct recipient of the credits under the XTIA, I first 
thought ENA could hang onto  $2.1 million ( the amount formerly allocated to 
Milestone 4 before its payment obligation was collapsed into Milestone 3) by 
deducting the refund from the amount payable  to CCSI on the option 
repurchase date and leaving CCSI to bear the risk of GE's repayment of any 
refund in order to make CCSI whole. If GE did meet the Milestone on time and 
so did not pay the refund amount directly to CCSI, I thought ENA could always 
make CCSI whole by paying the $2.1 million  in December when the refund 
matter was decided. That approach- subtracting the refund amount from the 
September 30 payment to CCSI- was decidedly unsatisfactory since the option 
repurchase formula could result - depending on the Milestones paid on the 
option repurchase date - in a negative payment to CCSI for the option. 

What I settled on in this draft was to go ahead and pay CCSI the amount of 
the premiums it has paid to September 30 plus $200,000 if the turbine 
contract has not been cancelled on September 30. This would include repayment 
to CCSI on September 30 of premiums paid by CCSI under the spark spread on 
September 30. Assuming CCSI made all its premium payments and West LB made 
all of its Development Fund advances, ENA would have received $9.9 million 
from CCSI by September 30, paid out $9.9 million plus interest to West LB by 
September 30, and purchased the spark spread from CCSI for $10.1 million. If 
the turbine contract is not cancelled but GE has to pay the refund, I think 
the $2.1 million ought to go to West LB or its designee (ENA).

If we cancel the turbine contract and do not go forward with Pastoria, the 
dollar amount of the credits vested in CCSI  and exercisable after December 
31,2000, are equal to the Development Funds advanced less the refund amount.  
Since the document now reads that the $2.1 refund amount goes back to West LB 
or its designee, if GE pays the refund and CCSI is holding a  Xonon credit of 
only $7.8 million,it seems to me it will be necessary  to pay the refund over 
to CCSI instead of ENA in order to make up for the fact that it paid $9.9 in 
premium and only received $7.8 in credit in September. This quick 
"liquidation" of $2.1 of the credit seems to be an ancillary benefit to CCSI 
occasioned by GE's refund. We could provide in the agreements that GE makes 
this payment directly to CCSI or we can continue to have the right to receive 
the payment from GE under the XTIA and the obligation to pay it to CCSI under 
the Repurchase Agreement.--------Separator------------

Subject:	1st Draft New Risk Management Policy

OK, here's the working draft "masterpiece" (haha).   Please review and provide comments and feedback by the end of the week (note: Ted and David, we have a conference call scheduled Wednesday for the three of us to discuss).   Also, I'm sending to Price Waterhouse Coopers for their input as well - I need to spend more time reviewing what they sent on Friday to see if I've missed any issues we want to address.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to "cushion" the reception. 

Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with:
?	Dave Gorte,
?	Bill Bradford and Molly Harris
?	Sally Beck's group (Beth Apollo and James New)
?	Treasury (Perkins and later, Despain)
?	Internal Audit (Kilchrist)
?	Legal (Sayre/Taylor)

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.  


Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.

You do not need to real Catherine McKalip-Thompson's full trip report from 
her European venture, but you did express some surprise that on her trip to 
Europe she went beyond policy and discussed "busienss" or commercial 
activities, as I recall our conversation.  her note below makes clear, to me, 
that partnerships and investments were discussed with, inter alia, a Dutch 
distribution company, Credit Lyonnais, and CGU (an insurer).  Just FYI.   mcs

John,

Attached is my trip report for Amsterdam, Paris and London - I've given the 
contact information for everyone to Kathy to be entered in the database and 
thank you notes are going out today.  

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was 
not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship 
with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the "gap financing" fund.UNEP 
conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First 
Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are 
quite interested in climate change business opportunities.  Also it provided 
a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable 
development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc.  Discussions with participants 
in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several 
working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is 
interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with 
them directly on that). I did not get the chance to meet up with Nicola Steen.

Catherine

The presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides:  
the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for 
utilities.  California's utilities were pushed to the brink of, or into, 
bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to 
them.  All parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise 
is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are 
conducted in a marketplace.

Also, did we cover the shortcomings of the Japanese market sufficiently?--------Separator------------

Subject: United Way

I attended the kick off and coordinator committee meetings for UW today.  The 
"Who wants to help Millions" game begins next Wed. (7/19) via email.  I think 
Steve could encourage participation from his group with an email sent out 
Tues. 7/18 similar to this:


Subject:  Millionaire Game!

Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions?  
Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via 
email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items).  
Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees 
to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be 
played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart 
representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your 
participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous 
participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE 
FUN!



Other items:

Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring 
and other activites during the year.  Other Enron business units will choose 
other UW agencies to sponsor through activities.  
We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign.  Do 
we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's 
car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on 
August 9?  We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get 
their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants.

Subject: Confidential Attorney Client Privilege - Attorney Work Product

I have drafted the attached letter denying the Cal ISO's request to send it 
(and the EOB) EPMI and EES' cost information for transactions over the FERC's 
cost cap.  Since I believe we are on very firm ground, my initial inclination 
was to send no response to the ISO's letter, so there would be nothing to 
quote in the press.  However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for 
purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before 
distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the 
message.

I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives 
them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting 
price protection.

The messages need to include Palmer's top three:  1) price  caps cause 
shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better 
solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long 
term problems.

On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the 
fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of 
conservation and demand side management technology today (including its 
availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . .  ie you 
don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).

Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT  

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City 
of Pittsburg?

Subject: Price Cap Media--DRAFT

Here's a draft.  Given sense of urgency, I tried to develop a target for 
folks to shoot at rather than The Perfect One-pager.  So please fire at 
will.  In particular, need PR to fill in "Media Approaches" and "Key Message 
Points."

Best,
Jeff

     John - This still needs work, particularly the double negative in section (h) (2), but I wanted to get it to you in case you needed something bright and early.    I'll noodle on it some more tonight.

In the underscored language added to the RTO section I would insert "access 
to" between the words "planning" and "maintenance".

I sent the following to Andy Black in order to ensure that we also discuss
the RTO/market power issues.  I'll bring copies to the meeting.  Please feel
free to take issue with the language.

Andy -

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.

I hope you find this helpful.  I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow.
